ABSTRACT
The following project aims to address the issue of data security breaches within companies by proposing a steganography tool as a solution. Through extensive research, it was identified that many companies suffer from data losses, suggesting the need for robust security measures. Additionally, the tool’s application extends to aiding fair journalism and reporting from regions with information restrictions, enhancing accessibility to vital information.
The research method comprehensively investigates various steganographic algorithms and encoding formats. Specifically, the study focussed on the working of algorithms such as Least Significant Bit (LSB) and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). Subsequently, an application has been developed to enable the encoding of textual data within images and text files, enhanced by encryption to fortify security measures.
The employed methodology encompassed rigorous exploration of different algorithms, evaluating their efficacy and applicability to the project’s objectives. Through careful development and testing, a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) was designed to facilitate usage.
Key findings indicate the successful implementation of the steganography tool, demonstrating its effectiveness in concealing textual data within various media formats. Incorporating encryption algorithms enhances the security and robustness of the tool, mitigating the risk of data breaches. In addition, the algorithms underwent assessment using performance evaluation metrics such as Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM).
